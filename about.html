      <h1>About This Platform</h1>
      <p>
        The Risk Monitor Platform on Interethnic Relations is an interactive
        tool developed to track and visualize key developments—both risks and
        positive examples—that impact interethnic relations in Kosovo. Hosted
        within our existing website, this platform serves as a real-time
        monitoring system that supports early warning efforts, fosters
        transparency, and informs decision-making for peacebuilding and social
        cohesion. At its core is a dynamic map of Kosovo that highlights
        incidents, public statements, and events with potential interethnic
        implications. Users can click on specific municipalities to access
        verified news reports tied to that location. Each entry includes: Date
        and location Brief event summary Photograph (where available) Bilingual
        content (Albanian and Serbian) In addition to documenting risks—such as
        violence, political tensions, or inflammatory rhetoric—the platform is
        also designed to highlight positive examples of interethnic cooperation,
        such as joint initiatives, community reconciliation efforts, and
        inclusive governance actions. By capturing both challenges and progress,
        the platform offers a balanced, evidence-based perspective on the state
        of interethnic relations in Kosovo. All entries are curated by our team,
        which regularly monitors credible sources to ensure accuracy and
        relevance. The reports are also compiled into a centralized, filterable
        table to support deeper analysis and policy response. The platform is
        intended for use by donors, policymakers, civil society actors,
        researchers, and the broader public who seek to better understand
        interethnic dynamics in Kosovo and contribute to sustainable peace and
        coexistence.
