      <h1>About This Platform</h1>
      <p>
        This platform is designed to monitor and document developments that
        shape interethnic relations in Kosovo, with the aim of supporting
        informed analysis, early warning, and confidence-building. The platform
        captures three core categories of developments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Interethnic Incidents:</strong> Acts or events—physical,
          verbal, symbolic, or institutional—that reflect tensions or conflict
          between communities on the basis of ethnic identity. Examples include
          hate speech, ethnically motivated violence or vandalism, and
          discriminatory practices or decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Positive Developments:</strong> Actions, initiatives, or
          events that foster peacebuilding and interethnic understanding,
          cooperation, or reconciliation. This can include joint community
          projects, inclusive policy decisions, public statements promoting
          coexistence, cross-community cultural or educational exchanges, and
          community leader efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Institutional Responses:</strong> Official actions taken by
          local or central institutions in response to incidents or developments
          affecting interethnic relations. These may include public
          condemnations, disciplinary or legal action, policy interventions, or
          outreach efforts aimed at de-escalation or reconciliation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Source Base and Verification</h2>
      <p>
        The platform is primarily based on secondary sources, including local
        and national media outlets, verified NGO reports, and publicly available
        institutional communications. All entries undergo basic verification
        procedures to assess credibility and minimize misinformation. However,
        as the platform relies on publicly accessible reporting and is subject
        to practical limitations, it does not claim to be exhaustive. We make
        our best efforts to ensure regular updates and balanced coverage, but
        some developments may go unreported or unverified. Therefore, the
        content should not be interpreted as a definitive or authoritative
        record of all interethnic dynamics in Kosovo.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This platform is designed to monitor and document developments related
        to interethnic relations in Kosovo, including positive initiatives,
        incidents, and institutional responses. While we strive to update the
        platform regularly and ensure accuracy, the information presented here
        is not exhaustive. Some events or developments may not be included due
        to limitations in data availability, verification, or reporting
        timelines. As such, this platform should not be considered a
        comprehensive or authoritative record of all interethnic developments in
        Kosovo.
